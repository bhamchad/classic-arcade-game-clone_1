===============================

A Frogger-style browser game, with a nod to the Marvel Universe (continuing the theme from my P2), implemented with JavaScript and HTML5 (Canvas).

Loki is controlled by using UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys. If Loki collides with Thor's hammer, he loses a life. Each time Loki makes it safely to the water, he restarts his journey at the bottom of the screen.
